# Object detection and localization using SSD

This project aims to detect and localize objects in images. Single Shot Detector(SSD) is used to build and train a CNN model.

### Video obtained after detection

Frames were taken from a video and the trained model was used to detect objects in the frames and draw bounding boxes around them. From this, video was stiched back. [Link_to_video.](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1AlC2w7Gmho8TguFeBsM1QtrU2dtIj3qr)
